# Business Sales Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an end-to-end exploratory data analysis on a retail sales dataset to identify trends, profitability drivers, and problem areas across categories, regions, and sub-categories.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world business analytics workflow – from raw data exploration to actionable business insights.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales and profit trends over time
- Identify high-performing and loss-making categories and sub-categories
- Understand the impact of discounting on profitability
- Compare business performance across regions
- Provide actionable insights for pricing and product strategy

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Git & GitHub**

## Key Analysis Performed

### 1. Sales & Profit Trend Analysis (Year-wise)
- Identified growth patterns and year-on-year changes in revenue and profit.

### 2. Category & Sub-Category Performance
- Compared Technology, Furniture, and Office Supplies categories.
- Drilled down into sub-categories to identify profit leakages (e.g., Tables, Bookcases).

### 3. Regional Performance Analysis
- Compared Sales and Profit across West, East, Central, and South regions.
- Observed weaker profitability in Central and South regions.

### 4. Discount vs Profit Analysis
- Analyzed how aggressive discounting impacts profitability.
- Identified categories and sub-categories where discounting leads to margin erosion.

### 5. Multi-Metric Radar Analysis
- Used radar charts to compare Sales, Profit, and Discount across categories.
- Confirmed that:
  - **Technology** drives both sales and profit
  - **Furniture** sales are discount-driven with weak profitability
  - **Office Supplies** operates on thin margins with moderate discount dependence

---

## Key Business Insights
- Technology is the primary growth and profit driver.
- Furniture category suffers from structural profitability issues due to heavy discounting and loss-making sub-categories.
- Certain sub-categories (Tables, Bookcases, Binders) require pricing and product mix review.
- West region shows healthy performance, while Central and South regions need strategic attention.
